## Research Hub: Matching Students and Research Projects

This project consists of three interconnected repositories that form the Research Hub application. Research Hub is designed to streamline the process of assigning research projects to students based on their specializations. 

### Application Overview

Research Hub provides a platform for teachers (faculty) to:

* Define research projects with specific skill requirements.
* View student profiles with listed specializations.
* Match students to projects based on their expertise.

Students can use Research Hub to:

* View available research projects.
* Express interest in projects matching their skills.

### Repositories

This project is divided into three main repositories:

1. **Research App ([https://github.com/ResearchHub24/Research-Hub](https://github.com/ResearchHub24/Research-Hub))**: This core application manages user accounts (teachers and students), research project details, student profiles, and matching functionalities.

2. **FCM Service ([https://github.com/ResearchHub24/ResearchHub-Fcm-Service](https://github.com/ResearchHub24/ResearchHub-Fcm-Service))**: This service utilizes Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to deliver real-time notifications to users about project assignments and updates.

3. **Streamlit App ([https://github.com/ResearchHub24/Research-Hub-Streamlit](https://github.com/ResearchHub24/Research-Hub-Streamlit))**: This optional component provides a user-friendly dashboard for visualizing project matching data and trends. (Note: Streamlit is a Python library for creating web apps).

### Installation and Setup

**Please refer to the individual README files for each repository for detailed installation and setup instructions:**

* Research App:  [Research-Hub](https://github.com/ResearchHub24/Research-Hub)
* FCM Service: [ResearchHub-Fcm-Service](https://github.com/ResearchHub24/ResearchHub-Fcm-Service)
* Streamlit App : [Research-Hub-Streamlit](https://github.com/ResearchHub24/Research-Hub-Streamlit)

**Note:** All three repositories need to be configured and running for the complete functionality of Research Hub. 

### Research and Contribution

This project is built upon research into optimizing research team formation based on skill matching. We welcome contributions to the codebase and further research into improving the Research Hub platform.
